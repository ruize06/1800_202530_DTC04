# Orbit

## Overview

Orbit is a client-side web application that aims to aid students with organization and planning. The app gives each user a personal to do list, and they can create groups with classmates and friends to always "Stay in Orbit" of each other.

Tasks can be shared between lists, and each has customization options with colours, deadlines, and longer descriptions for maximum versatility when users are planning. Orbit also offers a dashboard with summaries of upcoming tasks for an easy look into one's week without looking through lists.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

* App cannot be used, and tasks cannot be accessed without an internet connection.
* Reminders and alerts are not yet implemented, so users must check manually.
* Groups can share tasks, but there is no real-time editing or commenting.
* Orbit is web-only, there is no dedicated mobile or desktop apps.
* Accessibility features can be further improved.

### Future Work

* Add streaks, badges, or points to motivate users to complete tasks consistently.
* Enable attaching documents or images directly to tasks for more context.
* Introduce permissions (e.g., admins, editors, viewers) for better collaboration.
* Let users choose how and when they’re reminded for tasks, daily habits.
* Provide charts showing productivity trends, group contributions, or completion rates.
* Make Orbit accessible to non-English speakers with translations.
